# Sawyers_Adventure
Charitable contribution a team and I made to a local children's hospital.

Sawyer's Adventure is a first person adventure game that a team of game designers and I created in collaboration with Scotty's House. Scotty's House is a non-profit Child Advocacy Center that is based in my city, Bryan Texas. Sawyer is a professionally trained facility dog that works at Scotty's House and he is used to help the kids feel comfortable during the hard and confusing times they are going through. We spoke with the heads of Scotty's House and asked what we could do for them and this is it! This game is currently being used as a way to help the kids familiarize themselves with the building and help the kids build comfort with Sawyer.
